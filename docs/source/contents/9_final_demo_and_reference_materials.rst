Planning for Final Demo and Reference Materials
===============================================

Final Demo Requirements
-----------------------

==========================================================
Migrate two collections into the proof of concept platform
==========================================================

1. Knoxville Garden Slides - image collection with ​ some linked data ready metadata​ (subjects,
access conditions)
2. Druid - collection with several books containing associated images

=============
Configuration
=============

1. Minimal
2. Allow us to review functional requirements including Uploading, ingesting, and migrating processes and Mapping metadata for objects and collections
3. Browseable view of collections with search
4. Search results viw with collection level view and associated items plus metadata
5. Item view with enabled viewers and metadata configured for display
6. Demonstrate how metadata from the search index is configured for display and
search
7.Demonstrate how to access the IIIF manifest for objects and / or associated binaries

Reference Materials
-------------------

===============================
Diagrams of Sample Image Object
===============================

1. Object Modeling in PCDM
2. Data stored in Fedora
3. Data stored in MySQL/Postgres
4. Data stored elsewhere

=======================================================================
Document and Diagram Migration Process of our Current Fedora 3 Instance
=======================================================================

1. Recommend existing tools or utilities to leverage for migration

=============================================================================================
Document potential migration solutions for leveraging our linked-data platform ready metadata
=============================================================================================

1. Describe how mods:subject/mods:valueURI/[mods:topic] can be leveraged and mapped during migration
2. Describe how mods:accessCondition/xlink:href can be leveraged and mapped during migrations
3. Describe how mods:name/mods:valueURI/[mods:namePart] can be leveraged and mapped during migration

=========================================================
Document out-of-the-box metadata mapping from MODS to RDF
=========================================================

===================================================================
Document out-of-the-box mapping of our migrated metadata to OAI-PMH
===================================================================

=========================================
Document potential cloud-hosted solutions
=========================================

1. List potential platforms
2. List contact information

==============================================
Document potential CAS authentication solution
==============================================

==================================================
Document how the project’s community is structured
==================================================

1. How do you become a partner?
2. How many partners are there?
3. Are there fees involved?
4. How is governance and decision making handled?

===========================================================================
Document how the platform could be leveraged as an institutional repository
===========================================================================

1. Are institutions already using it for IR functionality?
2. If so, who?
3. If possible, describe which of the preferred IR functions are already in place.
