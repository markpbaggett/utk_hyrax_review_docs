About Hyrax
===========

For many years, the Hydra / Samvera community had two major front end solutions: CurationConcerns and Sufia. These
solutions were built on the Hydra framework and geared at separate needs. CurationConcerns' main focus was on digital
collections.  Sufia on the other hand was built for institutional repositories and therefore had functionality to support
self-deposit, proxy deposit, and mediated deposit. As both solutions matured they got their own unique features to fit
their specialties. In 2015, PCDM was realized and adopted by the Samvera community as a shared way to model content.
This adoption steered both platforms towards a common way of modeling objects.

At Hydra Connect 2016, a session was held based on a circulating white paper called
`"Should Sufia and CurationConcerns Merge?" <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkc2Cik1T3KXFQdS5UrU2XE3Kywd7di2IIjyo-T_Atc/edit>`_.
The results of the session and its discussion resulted in a decision to merge the Sufia and Curation Concerns code bases
into one front-end solution called `Hyrax <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax>`_.

Hyrax is currently on version 2.7.x.  A release candidate for `Hyrax 3.0.0 <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1>`_
was released in September 2019. The major new feature here is starting to support `Valkyrie <https://github.com/samvera/valkyrie/wiki>`_
as a replacement for ActiveFedora, Hyrax's persistence layer to Fedora. More information about this feature can be found
in the `Hyrax Valkyrie Usage Guide <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Valkyrie-Usage-Guide>`_.
