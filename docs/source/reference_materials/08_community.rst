VIII. Community
===============

Philosophy
----------

As taken from `its website <https://samvera.org/>`_,

    Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming **community** of information and technology professionals who share challenges,
    build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible
    now and into the future.

    Samvera’s suite of repository software tools offers flexible and rich user interfaces tailored to distinct content
    types on top of a robust back end – giving adopters the best of both worlds.

To be clear, Samvera is more of a **community** than it is a discrete software solution.

    Samvera software was conceived as an open source repository framework.  That is to say that we set out to create a
    series of free-to-use software **“building blocks”** that could put together in various combinations to achieve the
    repository system that an institution needed – as opposed to building a **“one size fits all”** solution.

The building blocks here are Ruby Gems.

    The Samvera framework as it exists today consists of a number of Ruby gems that can be combined, configured and adapted to
    serve a wide variety of digital repository needs.

This is very different from how Islandora 7 works.  While Islandora 7 is extensible and you can add or create modules
to add functionality to it, it is still a discrete thing. All institutions running Islandora 7 are running more or less
the same thing.  That is not necessarily the case in *"Samvera-land"* and definitely has not been the case historically.

In the early days of Samvera (Hydra), adopters started with basic building blocks to build the repository solution they
needed.

    Eventually, the more common approach became to find another institution whose use case was similar, clone their
    Samvera variant and then adapt it to more closely fit local needs.

Today, this is a little different.  About five years ago, the two biggest *Samvera variants*, **Curation Concerns**
and **Sufia**, merged into a common solution called **Hyrax**.

    Hyrax is the community-developed Ruby gem that allows users **to design and build their own**, customized installation
    of the Samvera software.

Again, this is still not necessarily discrete software and is most certainly a very different approach than Islandora 7.
The Samvera community believes having **Hyrax** instead of discrete software:

    ... allows an institution to build for themselves a repository solution closely fitted to their needs ...

I should also not that the Samvera community also recognizes that the:

    ... building process and later the maintenance of such a customized system can be resource intensive ...

Because of this, the Samvera Community has seen an emerging need for some off-the-shelf “solution bundles”,
addressing particular needs, that can be installed and maintained with fewer local resources – or that can be deployed
as a hosted, cloud service. Some examples of this are:

1. `Avalon <http://www.avalonmediasystem.org/project>`_: a time-based media solution
2. `Hyku <https://hyku.samvera.org/>`_: , which is based on Hyrax, allows users to build, bundle, and promote a feature-rich, robust, flexible digital repository that is easy to install, configure, and maintain. Hyku can be installed locally or run in the cloud; a number of service providers offer cloud-based, hosted versions.

Partners and Becoming a Partner
-------------------------------

The Samvera Community is built around a core group of Partners committed to the success of the project and more
importantly to the success of each other.  There are also many institutions and individuals that have formally committed
to the sustainability of the Community through code contributions, participation in working or interest groups, helping
with documentation, design, or planning.  No contribution is too small.

The Samvera governance model is shown in the diagram below.

Essentially there are several groups with overlapping membership.

================
Samvera Partners
================

Samvera’s Partners are the heart of the Community and formally share responsibility for its development.  They set
technical and Community direction; they contribute design and code; they organize events; they conduct training; they
help orient new adopters; they write documentation; and they advance the Community overall.  The Partners have a monthly
on-line conference call and meet annually at Samvera Connect whilst smaller regional groupings meet, generally once or
twice,at other times each year.

======================
Samvera Steering Group
======================

The Steering Group acts as a secretariat for the Community and manages its legal, financial, identity and communication
concerns. It serves as a formal representative for the Community, and the ultimate point of escalation, when either is
needed. The Steering Group consisted originally of representatives from our founding institutions but has since been
expanded; `the current membership can be found here <https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Steering+Group+membership>`_.

======================================
Interest, Working and Developer Groups
======================================

Interest, Working and Developer Groups span both Samvera’s Partners and other Community members. They address specific
topics (e.g. “Service Management”), tasks (e.g. updating the Samvera website), and technical issues (e.g. architectural
direction and code commits).  The Groups hold regular meetings, normally on-line, and conduct their business in an open
and transparent way.  Membership of Groups is open with the exception that all developers must have a
`Contributor Licence Agreement <https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Community+Intellectual+Property+Licensing+and+Ownership>`_
in place before code will be accepted from them, and all new code is subject to a peer review process.

A list of working groups can be found `here <https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Interest+Group+%28IG%29+and+Working+Group+%28WG%29+Hub>`_.

Adopters
========

The Samvera Community is open; it includes active participants and passive users who may not be Partners but still add
to the Community or derive benefit from it.  All are welcome!
