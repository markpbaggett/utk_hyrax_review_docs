VI. Cloud Hosting Solutions
===========================

Samvera is open source software and free to any would-be user, but the project benefits from a number of commercial
firms and individual contractors that are active in the community and offer for-fee services to interested institutions,
such as consulting, implementation, hosting, training, and more.

Below are some of the cloud hosting providers.

Data Curation Experts
---------------------

Data Curation Experts is a software design, development, and consulting firm, that focuses on enabling our clients to
build and support sustainable digital repository and archive solutions. They focus on collaboration and knowledge-transfer.

They offer services focusing on Samvera, Fedora, Solr, Blacklight, Spotlight and related technologies with a concentration on:

    Technical Design
    Software Development
    Hosting
    Training

Their client engagements typically range from one to twelve weeks in duration.

According to their website,

    We now offer Tenejo, our own hosted Samvera solutions based on the Hyrax repository engine. Using Amazon Web
    Services cloud infrastructure, we get you up and running quickly. Our DevOps team manages critical security patches
    throughout the year and ensures your Samvera instance stays up to-date during two planned upgrade windows each year.

During this investigation, I reached out to DCE to discuss our projects.  I was told that they were focused on getting
Tenejo ready for Hyrax 3.0 and would not be able to take on new clients until 2021.
