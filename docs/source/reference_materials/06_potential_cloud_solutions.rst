VI. Cloud Hosting Solutions
===========================

Samvera is open source software and free to any would-be user, but the project benefits from a number of commercial
firms and individual contractors that are active in the community and offer for-fee services to interested institutions,
such as consulting, implementation, hosting, training, and more.

Below are some of the cloud hosting providers.

Data Curation Experts
---------------------

Data Curation Experts is a software design, development, and consulting firm, that focuses on enabling our clients to
build and support sustainable digital repository and archive solutions. They focus on collaboration and knowledge-transfer.

They offer services focusing on Samvera, Fedora, Solr, Blacklight, Spotlight and related technologies with a concentration on:

    Technical Design
    Software Development
    Hosting
    Training

Their client engagements typically range from one to twelve weeks in duration.

According to their website,

    We now offer Tenejo, our own hosted Samvera solutions based on the Hyrax repository engine. Using Amazon Web
    Services cloud infrastructure, we get you up and running quickly. Our DevOps team manages critical security patches
    throughout the year and ensures your Samvera instance stays up to-date during two planned upgrade windows each year.

During this investigation, I reached out to DCE to discuss our projects.  I was told that they were focused on getting
Tenejo ready for Hyrax 3.0 and would not be able to take on new clients until 2021.

Notch8
------

Notch8 is another service provider in the Islandora community that offers a variety of cloud hosting options.

Notch8 is led by Rob Kaufman, the Hyku product owner. Notch 8 staff chair the Hyku interest group in the Samvera
community and host the Hyku workshop. In addition, Notch8 is the developer of two Hyku pilot projects:

* `DORIS <https://github.com/notch8/doris-hyku>`_
* `Hyku for Consortia <https://www.hykuforconsortia.org/>`_

They are also the developers for `Bulkrax <https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax>`_,  the most popular Import/Export
gem for bulk data migrations.

Finally, they are a vendor that have worked for large libraries like the University of Indiana on the development of
Flexible Metadata.

Notch 8 has a few flavors of cloud-hosting.  The first is `HykuUp <https://www.hykuup.com/>`_. This is a multitenant
service for running Hyku.  It is targeted at libraries that want to mostly run Hyku "out-of-the-box." While this might
be too limiting for our needs, Notch8 also offers a separate service where they help you run and manage your custom
Hyku instance on you cloud hosting provider of choice.
