Other Notes
===========

1. It took me several days to even get anything running, so I've only technically been playing with this since May 8, 2020.
2. In other words, I don't know very much yet and am still learning.
3. I have **way too much content** for this presentation.  When I've gone 30 minutes, someone please let me know so I can stop and answer questions.
4. If we have time at the end, I'll show anything I didn't get to or if we don't get to it at the end I'm happy to talk afterwards.
